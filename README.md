# sysad

This repo contains system admin files for fedora 23 and up. As it currently stands, I am adding BASH scripts to this repo that will include the scripts from an online course from Udemy on BASH programming. I may also include some nmap scripts in here. Later, I intend to add python scripts for automating various sysad tasks following the texts: __Automate the Boring Stuff__, Python for Unix and Linux System Administration (Gift, N, & Jones, J, 2008).
